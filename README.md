# DateMate

## Description

This program's objective is to present the user with random recommendations for a food recipe, movie, and wine selection when the main button is pressed. If the user decides they do not like the options presented they may then opt to randomize all options again by pressing the main button or only randomize one option by clicking the corresponding button.

The [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) APIs were used to generate the data about the food/wine and movie recommendation.
